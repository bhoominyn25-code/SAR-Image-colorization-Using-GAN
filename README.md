# SAR Image Colorization Using GAN

A deep learning project for **colorizing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images** by generating corresponding RGB/optical images using a **Pix2Pix Conditional GAN (cGAN)**.

The project learns the mapping:

**SAR Image → Generator (U-Net) → Generated RGB Image**

The generated image is compared with the corresponding real RGB image from the paired dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images contain useful information about the Earth's surface but are generally represented in grayscale and can be difficult to interpret visually.

This project uses a **conditional Generative Adversarial Network (Pix2Pix)** to learn the relationship between SAR images and their corresponding optical/RGB images.

The goal is to generate an RGB-like representation from a SAR input while preserving important structures and visual information.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Convert SAR images into visually interpretable RGB images.
- Learn the SAR-to-optical mapping using paired image data.
- Use a Pix2Pix GAN architecture for conditional image-to-image translation.
- Compare generated RGB images with their corresponding real RGB images.
- Evaluate generated results using image-quality metrics such as **PSNR, SSIM, and FID**.

## 📊 Dataset

### SARPTICAL Dataset

The project uses the **SARPTICAL dataset**, which provides paired SAR and optical/RGB imagery.

Each training sample consists of:

| Data | Description |
|---|---|
| SAR Image | Input Synthetic Aperture Radar image |
| RGB Image | Corresponding optical/RGB target image |

The paired data allows the Pix2Pix model to learn a direct mapping between the SAR input and its corresponding RGB representation.

### Input Size

The images used by the model are processed to:

```text
112 × 112 pixels
```

> The dataset itself is not included in this repository because of its size. The repository contains the source code required to load and process the dataset.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The project uses **Pix2Pix**, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network designed for paired image-to-image translation.

### Generator

The **Generator** uses a **U-Net architecture**.

```

The skip connections help preserve spatial and structural information from the input SAR image.

### Discriminator

The **Discriminator** uses a **PatchGAN** architecture.

It evaluates local image patches instead of treating the complete image as a single unit. This helps encourage sharper and more realistic local details.

```

The model uses a combination of:

- **Adversarial Loss** to encourage realistic generated images.
- **L1 Loss** to keep the generated image close to the ground-truth RGB image.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

The generated images can be evaluated using:

### PSNR
**Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio** measures the similarity between the generated image and the ground-truth image. Higher PSNR generally indicates lower pixel-level reconstruction error.

### SSIM
**Structural Similarity Index** measures similarity in structural information, luminance, and contrast between images.

### FID
**Fréchet Inception Distance** compares the distributions of generated and real images using feature representations. Lower FID generally indicates closer feature distributions.
